## Total Files Archived

**2 files** consolidated into **1 comprehensive reference**

---

## Why These Files Were Archived

1. **Redundancy**: Both files covered MIDI validation, with overlap
2. **Chronological Split**: COMPARISON_RESULTS was initial testing, SUMMARY was final - confusing
3. **Fragmentation**: Information split between two documents
4. **Version Confusion**: No clear single source of truth

---

## Consolidated Documentation Benefits

1. **Single Source of Truth**: One comprehensive MIDI validation reference
2. **Complete Coverage**: All content from both documents merged and updated
3. **Clear Organization**: Structured with table of contents and logical sections
4. **Current Version**: Updated to v2.0.0 with latest status
5. **Better Navigation**: Complete reference for all MIDI validation topics
